## Background

CVD disease (CVD) is one of the most serious health issues and leading cause of sudden death in the worldwide. 
It is a common issue in both developed countries and developing countries. 
Risk factors for the CVD basically categorize demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental, and physiological factors.

But there may be some other factors that matter.
There for it is very important to gather and analyze CVD death information  to make any decision on minimizing CVD death rates.

## Scope of the project 
 
In this project analysis is limited to the counties only in Unites Sates of America (USA).
Further analysis is limited to the demographic risk factor among various risk factors associated with the CVD death rate. 

## Data source
- [catalog.data.gov :Published by U.S. Department of Health & Human Services](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey-nhanes-national-cardiovascular-disease-su)

## Area of analysis
- Geographic distribution of the CVD death rate.
- Effect of the smoking behavior to the CVD death rate  
- Distribution of Heart disease among ethnicities.
- Distribution of Heart disease among gender groups.

## Folder structure

## Summary of the analysis
- Higher CVD death rates can be seen in the south regions of the country having above the country average.
- CVD death rate of some counties in southern era is more than the double as country average.
- There is a notable increase in CVD mortality for men in the USA.
- Black ethnicity  have an higher mortality rate than other ethnic groups while Asian having low rate
- There is a positive relationship between smoking rate and the CVD death rate.
- CVD death rate of Minnesota fell top lowest among the states.
- Western side of Minnesota is where the top 2 areas from cvd death occurred.
- 

## Next  stage 
Seeing the summary of the analysis it is noticeable that the southern area of the country having higher CVD death rate.

And higher CVD death rate for male.

As a next step, need a deep dive on other factors like socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental, and physiological factors that directly to CVD death rate of that south regions area.
